# Healthier
Healthier is a health tracker application which is planned, designed and implemented for Software Development Practice (SWE 573) 2016 Fall project. In this application, users can track their food consumptions, physical activities, and body mass indexes. They also define and try to achieve customized goals such as losing weight or getting enough nutrients.  By showing eating and consumption reports, the application helps users to control and/or plan their eating and physical activities. 



# Requirements

Because Github's current markdown implementation does not properly render [nested enumerated lists][1], the require document will be maintained in [a google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JM05Z4752BKu_EsHfXURPDfS_2sqV1slaiLKKQlkuWk/edit?usp=sharing). This document can be viewed anonymously. 


Considering the difficulties of managing an open source material on Google Docs, the document will not be editable. Please report your change requests related to requirements in Github's issue system.

Do not forget to specify its enumerated number when mentioning a requirement in a code comment or in an issue.

# Time management

To make time management for this project, Toggl (https://toggl.com) and Google Doc Spreadsheet are used. 

### The methodology

Time management should be done by following the steps listed below.

1. open an issue in Github's issue tracker for the task to be done
2. add this issue as a new row in the spreadsheet document.
3. estimate how many minutes it is going to take you and enter your estimation.
4. when you are starting to work on a task, start toggl's time tracker as well.
5. when you are done, stop toggle's time tracker and enter how many minutes it took into the spreadsheet document.
